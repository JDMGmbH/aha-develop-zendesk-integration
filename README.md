## Working on the extension

Install `aha-cli`:

```sh
npm install -g aha-cli
```

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aha-develop/zendesk.git
```

Install required modules:

```sh
yarn install
```

**Note: In order to install an extension into your Aha! Develop account, you must be an account administrator.**

Install the extension into Aha! and set up a watcher:

```sh
aha extension:install
aha extension:watch
```

Now, any change you make inside your working copy will automatically take effect in your Aha! account.

## Building

When you have finished working on your extension, package it into a `.gz` file so that others can install it:

```sh
aha extension:build
```

After building, you can upload the `.gz` file to a publicly accessible URL, such as a GitHub release, so that others can install it using that URL.
